# Machine_Learning

This repository contains a summary of the statistical and machine learning techniques that I investigated while on a 6 month (12 months, part time) placement with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS). 

These are working notes and have not been fully edited.
